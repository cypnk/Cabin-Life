# Protected Static Dissipation

When working in an environment which is conducive to electrostatic charge generation, it is necessary to safely discharge without affecting any sensitve components being used. Discharging static electricity may be accomplished with a simple wire to ground, however, this may be dangrous as it allows for high currents to pass through the body, should a live wire be accidentally touched while also being grounded. To protect the user, any work or components being used, and allow for static dissipation, the following circuit may be used.

The circuit allows for a separate touch plate, used to dissipate any static in clothing, before sitting down to work. The work surface itself has a relatively low impedence path to ground to continously drain any staic buildup, while also protecting components if there is a high static gradient in the ground path.

The absolute values of the components is not critical. The inductor in the work surface ground path may be a hand wound toroidal coil or a commercial alternative.
