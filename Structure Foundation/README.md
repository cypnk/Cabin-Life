# Structure Foundation
This is a common structural base for most types of small shelters or tiny cabins which may be built by a single individual without specialized equipment. Common hand tools may be used, however power tools and a power supply are recommended. Building materials are those typically found in the U.S., where the author resides, however some aspects may be extrapolated elsewhere. Dimensions are in U.S. building units.

The base consists of wooden members which may be constructed on skids (beams) of pressure treated lumber. In this example, 4"x4" posts up to a desired length are laid on concrete pads or ground which has been prepared for good drainage E.G. Crushed and leveled stone. The structure may also be built on piers, however bracing and reinforcement will be necessary.

This design has an accompanying [blog post](https://rc.sh2.us/2020/07/19/building-foundations) with further design rationale.

## Materials
* Landscape fabric to inhibit root intrusion under the structure
* Crushed stone or gravel or similar ground preparation material with good drainage and increased friction to prevent movement (must not be smooth for better friction)
* Concrete pavers (recommended)
* 4"x4" Pressure treated lumber posts
* 4'x8' Pressure treated plywood sheets (at least 3/4" thickness, tongue and groove recommended)
* 4'x8' Interior rated plywood, OSB sheets, or flooring rated composite sheets (5/8" - 1" thickness, tongue and groove recommended)
* 2"x6" Pressure treated joist members cut to desired length (2 outer members extend fully from edge-to-edge, while the remaining members are cut to fit)
* Treated lumber compatible or decking rated 3" screws (recommended) or hot-dip galvanized nails
* Decking rated construction adhesive to increase durability of the structure and reduce future movement and squeaks
* Insulation (optional) non-fiber, reflective, "bubble wrap" style recommended to avoid attracting rodents as with fiber-style insulation, and to act as a vapor barrier

## Tools
* Impact driver or powered screwdriver and bits (for screws) or hammer (for nails)
* Powered circular saw (recommended) or hand saw
* 4' Or longer level
* Ground tamper (recommended)
* Shovel

## Ground preparation
The uppermost layer of vegetation should be removed and the ground reasonably leveled and tamped. The landscape fabric is laid to at least 2' beyond the footprint of the desired size of the structural base. Crushed stone is used to completely cover the fabric up to at least 6" depth and pressure treated members may be used to contain the stone. Level is used, optionally with a straight piece of lumber material, to ensure the stone base is flat. A shallow drainage ditch may be dug around the structure base, beyond the stone material, to allow rainwater to be carried away to a lower spot on the build site. Concrete pavers should be placed in formation where the 4"x4" beams are to be placed.

## Construction

Overall base structure with the top panel rendered transparent to see the joist layout.

The beams are laid equidistant to each other, such that the exterior width of this particular structure is 8'. This example uses 8' lengths, which conforms to typical U.S. building supplies, such that the overall structural base is a square.

The next layer consists of pressure treated plywood sheets, glued and screwed to the beams. This is only to hold them in place and more fasteners will be used later. As long as the plywood sheets are square, the base will also be square as long as they are properly installed. The center beam may be located by measuring the halfway point on the sheets and ensuring the middle of the beam is at the center mark. The plywood should be flush to the outer side beams. The sheets are laid such that the seam between them is perpendicular to the beam layout. If tongue and groove sheets are not available, glue between the sheets is recommended. This effectively seals the base from the outdoor environment once the structural joists are added.

The joist layout is 16" on center, following typical North American building format, however this can be extrapolated to the local building codes. The outer rim of joists are cut to the lengths of the bottom plywood sheets and glued and screwed to the base. The interior joists are cut to space after measuring from the inside dimensions. At least 3 fasteners per edge should be used to join the middle members to the outer side joists. As with the beams, as long as the plywood is square and properly installed, the joists will also be square.

Blocking is cut to fit between joists and glued and screwed in a staggered pattern. The blocking stagger placement should not exceed the width of the bottom beam on which they rest. Only 2 fasteners may be used for the blocking on each edge. The joist frame should be screwed at an angle through the joist, the bottom plywood layer, and into the 4"x4" beams every 8".

In this example, the 16" on center joist placement creates a member very close to the edge, which may seem redundant. However, this placement may be used on the entrance side, which will see the most foot traffic.

Following the joist installation, floor insulation may now be added if that feature is desired.

The next and final layer is standard plywood or OSB (Oriented Strand Board and similar products) as this layer will not be exposed to the elements once the rest of the structure is built on top of it.

This layout may be extended during the initial planning phase to accommodate a larger structure. Here is a 8'x12' layout using the same building principles.

This sealed structural base enables the structure to be moved, if necessary, at a future date.
