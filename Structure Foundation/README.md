# Structure Foundation
This is a common structural base for most types of small shelters or tiny cabins which may be built by a single individual without specialized equipment. Common hand tools may be used, however power tools and a power supply are recommended. Building materials are those typically found in the U.S., where the author resides, however some aspects may be extrapolated elsewhere. Dimensions are in U.S. building units.

The base consists of wooden members which may be constructed on skids (beams) of pressure treated lumber. In this example, 4"x4" posts up to a desired length are laid on concrete pads or ground which has been prepared for good drainage E.G. Crushed and leveled stone. The structure may also be built on piers, however bracing and reinforcement will be necessary.

Materials:
* 4"x4" Pressure treated lumber posts
* 4'x8' Pressure treated plywood sheets (at least 3/4" thickness, tongue and groove recommened)
* 4'x8' Interior rated plywood, OSB sheets, or flooring rated composite sheets (5/8" - 1" thickness, tongue and groove recommened)
* Treated lumber compatible or decking rated 3" screws
* Construction adhesive
* Insulation (optional)

The beams are laid equidistant to each other, such that the exterior width of this particular structure is 8'. This example uses 8' lengths, which conforms to typical U.S. building supplies, such that the overall structural base is a square.

The next layer consists of pressure treated plywood sheets, glued and screwed to the beams. The sheets are laid such that the seam between them is perpendicular to the beam layout. If tongue and groove sheets are not available, glue between the sheets is recommended. This effectively seals the base from the outdoor environment once the structural joists are added.

The joist layout is 16" on center, following typical North American building format, however this can be extrapolated to the local building codes. The outer rim of joists are cut to the lengths of the bottom plywood sheets and glued and screwed to the base. The interior joists are cut to space after measuring from the inside dimensions. Blocking is cut between joists and glued and screwed in a staggered pattern. The blocking edges should not exceed the width of the bottom beam on which they rest.

Following the joist installation, floor insulation may now be added if that feature is desired.

The next and final layer is standard plywood or OSB (Oriented Strand Board and similar products) as this layer will not be exposed to the elements once the rest of the structure is built on top of it.

This layout may be extended during the initial planning phase to accommodate a larger structure. Here is a 8'x12' layout using the same building principles.

This sealed structural base enables the structure to be moved, if necessary, at a future date.
