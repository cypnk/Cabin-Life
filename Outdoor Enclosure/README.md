# Outdoor Enclosure

This is a multi-function enclosure design for use as an outdoor terminal, kiosk, solar-powered battery charging station, or similar function where exposure to the elements is expected and internal components need to be protected for a significant period of time. 

The enclosure can be made of cut stainless steel sheets or moulded ABS plastic, depending on the type of use and available materials. In cold weather environments, an inner layer of insulation may be required between the components and outer housing. The sizes may be adjusted as needed and can be approximately 300cm wide and 700cm tall. The depth, depending on whether the enclosure will house batteries, can be 650cm or narrower. The cut angle of the weather hood is 45 degrees and there is a small drip edge underneath to prevent water from coming closer to the screen cutout. The screen itself may be e-Ink, OLED, TFT, or similar.

Front profile view of the outdoor enclosure including the screen. The cutout size may be adjusted to whichever type of screen is to be used, however a durable type capable of operating in a wide temperature range is recommended. The screen face may be shielded with plexiglass or other abrasion resistant material.

Side profile view. The hood length can be adjusted to the situation, however a long length offers more protection. If made from ABS vacuum formed sheets, a top arch can be added to make shedding water easier.

Placement of the front panel. The screen is recessed far back from the hood end such that it is protected from the elements and offers privacy if the enclosure is installed in a busy area. Note the drip edge at the tip of the weather hood.

If the enclosure is to be used as a battery charging station or outdoor terminal, 3.2V LiFePOâ‚„ batteries may be grouped to create a 12V bundle. AGM and other lead based batteries are not recommended due to the small size of the enclosure and concentration of weight.

Alternatively, 8 cells can be stacked to create a 24V bundle. Actual charging capacity will vary widely depending on the battery model, manufacturer, age of the cells, and charging electronics. This is the maximum capacity of the enclosure when allowing headroom for the screen electronics, charge controller, and possible inverter components.

The screen, once installed, may be controlled with a Raspberry Pi or similar single-board-computer. Here shown mounted to the inside front face. It is recommended the computer be placed as close to the screen as possible to reduce the cable length and therefore susceptibility to interference going to the screen.

Outdoor rated plywood or other flat, sturdy, building material may be used to create a pedestal for the enclosure, provided it will not carry more than the structural capacity of the building material.

Pedestal construction with plywood. Additional anchoring may be required if installing in a windy area as the weight of the enclosure and its contents may be insufficient to keep it upright.

Alternatively, a sturdy pole driven at least 1m or 3 feet into the ground may be used if the enclosure contents is to be solar powered. A full complement of batteries may not be supported by the pole method. This may be installed as a solitary unit without additional signal wiring to a home station if the contents will operate wirelessly.
