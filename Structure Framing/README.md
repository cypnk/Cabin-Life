# Structure Framing
This is a basic framing layout for a multi-purpose small structure, such as a shed, small reading room, tea room, or writer's retreat. This design is meant to be installed top of the [Structure Foundation](https://github.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/tree/master/Structure%20Foundation)

Design in progress...
