# Power Storage

A durable, fault-tolerant, rechargeable system based on the Zinc bromide (ZnBr₂) battery chemistry. The primary benefit of this battery type is the limited skill necessary to make them. The properties of the chemistry make it appropriate for locations where ready access isn't possible year round and so will receive little attention by necessity.

Other benefits include readily available and relatively cheap replacement parts and electrolyte raw ingredients. When stored in properly sealed containers, the raw ingredients for the electrolyte have an indefinite shelf-life. The electrolyte can be made in situ with simple household utensils. The battery can be fully discharged to 0% without permanent damage, unlike LiFePO₄ batteries, and can be left for months or years in the discharged state and is far less susceptible to temperature extremes. This type of battery should exceed several thousand charge cycles before needing electroylte replenishment.

Potential drawbacks are that the energy density per volume is far lower than LiFePO₄, which means larger cells for equivalent capacity. The battery may be difficult to move, depending on the type of container used, once assembled and must be checked for leaks before filling with the electrolyte since it's a liquid battery. Charging may produce H², similar to lead acid batteries, especially at higher currents. Potential Bromine gas release is possible, which may cause "pool smell". The battery must be periodically shorted to 0% charge to reduce electrode dendrite buildup.

Potential solutions to drawbacks include using end-sealed lengths of PVC pipe as containers, which are already leak resistant and allow easier movement once assembled. A gelling agent such as Sodium polyacrylate may used on the electrolyte and the patent for this process has already expired. A venting system similar to when charging lead acid batteries can be used to take care of undesirable gases. Using a timing system, multiple batteries can be set to charge/discharge on different days or skip charging entirely using a controller connected to automotive or solid-state relays for each each battery. The logic for such a system may be hard-wired using simple TTL chips if a microcontroller is unavailable or undesirable.

**Electrolyte components:**
* Zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄). Available as a dietary supplement or for other pharmaceutical use
* Sodium bromide (NaBr). Available as a disinfectant for swimming pools and hot tubs
* Distilled water

Premade Zinc bromide can be purchased, however it may not be readily available in all areas and may be costly.

**Test cell components:**
* Heavy duty, reclosable, plastic storage bag
* 14-16AWG wire with outdoor rated insulator
* Zinc wire and/or zinc strips
* Graphite foil sheets without binders or inserts. Available as gaskets or seals for high-temperature applications

**Final cell components:**
* 4" PVC schedule-40 pipes (locales outside the U.S. may use equivalent sizes) or similar PVC underground conduit
* PVC cement (with primer or primer combination recommended)
* Threaded end caps and couplings
* Pressure fit end caps
* 12AWG wire with outdoor rated insulator
* Zinc flashing roll or similar Zinc strip at least 2.5" or 6.25cm to 6.5cm wide (or similar strip which can be coiled)
* Graphite foil sheets

**Tools and utensils:**
* Metal snips, also called tin snips or aviation snips
* Pliers
* Steel wool (to clean the Zinc in case of surface impurities, not needed if Zinc is clean)
