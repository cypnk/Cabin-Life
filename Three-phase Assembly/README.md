# Three-phase assembly

A coil stator and magnet arrangement which can be used as an electric generator or motor. All parts may be scavenged or improvised as needed. The performance of the assembly depends on the type of components used and the speed of rotation. Exact components are left up to the builder, depending preference and local availability.

## Concept

The stator coils are made from identically cut segments of *0 AWG* to *4 AWG* stranded copper wire, in lieu of pre-wound coils. Dedicated magnet wire coils may be used, but these may be in short supply, too expensive, or unavailable. CCA or Copper-Clad Aluminum wire is not recommended. The magnets may be neodymium for increased performance, however, ferrite magnets of equivalent size may be used if there is not an adequate supply. The magnets must be of identical size and weight to avoid balance and vibration issues during operation.

The end terminals of the assembly are left separated so they may be wired in **Delta configuration** or **Y (WYE) configuration**. There are [benefits and drawbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power#Balanced_circuits) to each configuration and it may be necessary to change the assembly after construction or, in motor-mode, change during operation using a [soft starter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_soft_starter).

Supplies:
* Neodymium bar type (recommended) or round magnets with axial North South polarity (flat face N or S), slightly wider than selected wire
* * Ferrite (iron-ceramic) magnets may be used, but with lower performance
* 0 To 4 AWG or similarly thick *stranded* copper wire (E.G. battery cable, welding cable etc...)
* 12 To 14 AWG household-grade copper wiring
* 5/8" (~16+mm) to 1" (~25+mm) smooth, round, shaft rod or wheelbarrow axle
* Pillow block bearings, of flanged type or end type, matching the selected shaft diameter
* Locking collars matching the shaft diameter
* Crimped or soldered cable lugs, with throughholes
* 1/4" (~6.5mm) to 5/8" (~16mm) Allthread (this size is not critical)
* Nuts and washers matching the selected diameter allthread
* Screws and nuts matching cable lug holes
* HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) sheets at least as thick as the cable
* * Kitchen cutting boards may be used as HDPE material or marine grade plywood may be substituted if HDPE is not available
* Short lengths of bus bar or roll of copper
* * Copper flashing strips may be used if bus bar is not available

Tools:
* Crimping tool if crimped lugs are used
* Soldering iron and acid-free solder
* Hand drill or drill press
* Drill bits matching the selected cable lug holes
* Screwdriver or hex key (allen wrench) matching the tightening screw of the locking collars
* Hole saw with a diameter slightly larger than the selected locking collars
* Hand saw or router
* Wire stripping tool or box cutter
* Ruler or measuring tape
* Marker or pencil
* Hand saw or band saw
* Sandpaper
* Drawing compass or piece of string
* Wrench(es) matching all selected nuts
* Screwdriver(s) matching all selected screws
* Gloves (recommended when handling allthread, which can be sharp)

## Build process

***IMPORTANT: Avoid leaving dissimilar metals in contact with each other to reduce the risk of galvanic corrosion.*** Only use copper wire with copper connectors or metals specially coated to prevent galvanic corrosion while allowing good electrical contact. Some connections may need to be soldered to prevent corrosion.

The assembly is built in segment multiples of 3, to match the number of poles of the output/input. For a balance of power and ease of construction, assemblies between 12 and 24 segments are recommended. Increasing the number of segments will add to the output power in generator-mode or torque in motor-mode, however there is a practical upper limit. Builder discretion is advised.

The magnets should as wide or slightly wider than the selected wire gauge.

Note: Due to angular momentum of the rotor, which will have the magnets attached and will be spinning, it is recommended the magnet not exceed the thickness of the substrate (HDPE or marine-grade plywood) too much.

Cut the selected wire into segments slightly taller than the selected magnet, allowing for the wire lugs above and below.

Leaving the wire sheath intact is strongly recommended to protect the it from corrosion and the elements, as well as reduce the risk of electrical shorts, however it may be stripped for slightly increased performance by reducing magnet-to-wire tolerances. Magnet effectiveness will rapidly diminish with distance and leaving too much exposed wire, beyond what is needed for the wire lugs, will not meaningfully increase output power or torque.

The wire and magnet pairs are eventually arranged in a radial pattern on the selected substrate of HDPE board or marine-grade plywood.
