# Three-phase assembly

A coil stator and magnet arragement which can be used as an electric generator or motor.

The magnets may be neodymium for increased performance, however, ferrite magnets of equivalent size may be used if there is not an adequate supply. The stator coils are made from identically cut segments of 0 - 4 AWG stranded copper wire, in lieu of pre-wound coils. Dedicated magnet wire coils may be used, but these may be in short supply, too expensive, or unavailable.

All parts may be scavanged or improvised as needed. CCA or Copper-Clad Aluminum wire is not recommended. The performance of the assembly depends on the type of components used and the speed of rotation. Exact components are left up to the builder, depending preference and local availability.

Supplies:
* Neodymium bar type (recommended) or round magnets with axial North South polarity (flat face N or S)
* * Ferrite (iron-ceramic) magnets may be used, but with lower performance
* 0 To 4 AWG or similarly thick *stranded* copper wire (E.G. battery cable, welding cable etc...)
* 12 To 14 AWG household-grade copper wiring
* 5/8" (~16+mm) to 1" (~25+mm) smooth, round, shaft rod or wheelbarrow axle
* Pillow block bearings, of flanged type or end type, matching the selected shaft diameter
* Locking collars matching the shaft diameter
* Crimped or soldered cable lugs, with throughholes
* 1/4" (~6.5mm) to 5/8" (~16mm) Allthread
* Nuts and washers matching the selected diameter allthread
* Screws and nuts matching cable lug holes
* HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) sheets at least as thick as the cable
* * Kitchen cutting boards may be used as HDPE material or marine grade plywood may be substituted if HDPE is not available
* Short lengths of bus bar or roll of copper
* * Copper flashing strips may be used if bus bar is not available

Tools:
* Crimping tool if crimped lugs are used
* Soldering iron and solder6.35
* Hand drill 
* Bits matching the selected cable lug holes
* Bit matching the tightening screw of the locking collars
* Hole saw with a diameter slightly larger than the selected locking collars
* Hand saw or router
* Wire stripping tool or box cutter
* Ruler or measuring tape
* Marker or pencil
* Hand saw or band saw
* Sandpaper
* Drawing compass or piece of string
* Wrench(es) matching all selected nuts
* Screwdriver(s) matching all selected screws
* Gloves (recommended when handling allthread, which can be sharp)
