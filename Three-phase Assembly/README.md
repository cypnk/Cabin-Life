# Three-phase assembly

A coil stator and magnet arrangement which can be used as an electric generator or motor. All parts may be scavenged or improvised as needed. The performance of the assembly depends on the type of components used and the speed of rotation. Exact components are left up to the builder, depending preference and local availability.

## Concept

The stator coils are made from identically cut segments of *0 AWG* to *4 AWG* stranded copper wire, in lieu of pre-wound coils. Dedicated magnet wire coils may be used, but these may be in short supply, too expensive, or unavailable. CCA or Copper-Clad Aluminum wire is not recommended. The magnets may be neodymium for increased performance, however, ferrite magnets of equivalent size may be used if there is not an adequate supply. The magnets must be of identical size and weight to avoid balance and vibration issues during operation.

The end terminals of the assembly are left separated so they may be wired in **Delta configuration** or **Y (WYE) configuration**. There are [benefits and drawbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power#Balanced_circuits) to each configuration and it may be necessary to change the assembly after construction or, in motor-mode, change during operation using a [soft starter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_soft_starter).

Supplies:
* Neodymium bar type (recommended) or round magnets with axial North South polarity (flat face N or S), slightly wider than selected wire
* * Ferrite (iron-ceramic) magnets may be used, but with lower performance
* 0 To 4 AWG or similarly thick *stranded* copper wire (E.G. battery cable, welding cable etc...)
* 12 To 14 AWG household-grade copper wiring
* 5/8" (~16+mm) to 1" (~25+mm) smooth, round, shaft rod or wheelbarrow axle
* Pillow block bearings, of flanged type or end type, matching the selected shaft diameter
* Locking collars matching the shaft diameter
* Crimped or soldered cable lugs, with throughholes
* 1/4" (~6.5mm) to 5/8" (~16mm) Allthread (this size is not critical)
* Nuts and washers matching the selected diameter allthread
* Screws and nuts matching cable lug holes
* HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) sheets at least as thick as the cable
* * Kitchen cutting boards may be used as HDPE material or marine grade plywood may be substituted if HDPE is not available
* Short lengths of bus bar or roll of copper
* * Copper flashing strips may be used if bus bar is not available

Tools:
* Crimping tool if crimped lugs are used
* Soldering iron and acid-free solder
* Hand drill or drill press

* Marker or pencil
* Hand saw or band saw
* Sandpaper
* Drawing compass or piece of string
* Wrench(es) matching all selected nuts
* Screwdriver(s) matching all selected screws
* Gloves (recommended when handling allthread, which can be sharp)

## Build process

***IMPORTANT: Avoid leaving dissimilar metals in contact with each other to reduce the risk of galvanic corrosion.*** Only use copper wire with copper connectors or metals specially coated to prevent galvanic corrosion while allowing good electrical contact. Some connections may need to be soldered to prevent corrosion.

### Stator coils
The assembly is built in segment multiples of 3, to match the number of poles of the output/input. For a balance of power and ease of construction, assemblies between 12 and 24 segments are recommended. Increasing the number of segments will add to the output power in generator-mode or torque in motor-mode, however there is a practical upper limit. Builder discretion is advised.

The magnets should as wide or slightly wider than the selected wire gauge.
![magnet wire top](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/magnet_wire_top.png)

Note: Due to angular momentum of the rotor, which will have the magnets attached and will be spinning, it is recommended the magnet not exceed the thickness of the substrate (HDPE or marine-grade plywood) too much.

Cut the selected wire into segments slightly taller than the selected magnet, allowing for the wire lugs above and below.
![magnet wire side](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/magnet_wire_side.png)

Leaving the wire sheath intact is strongly recommended to protect the it from corrosion and the elements, as well as reduce the risk of electrical shorts, however it may be stripped for slightly increased performance by reducing magnet-to-wire tolerances. Magnet effectiveness will rapidly diminish with distance and leaving too much exposed wire, beyond what is needed for the wire lugs, will not meaningfully increase output power or torque.

The wire and magnet pairs are eventually arranged in a radial pattern on the selected substrate of HDPE board or marine-grade plywood.

Wire layout for a 24 segment 3-pole assembly. Note, the diameter of the assembly must increase to accommodate the greater number of components:
![larger stator wire layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/stator_wire_layout_large.png)

The number of magnets used must match the number of wire segments:
![magnet layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/magnet_layout.png)

The wire lugs used in this example are of the solder type, however crimp style lugs may be used. Use of lugs is strongly recommended in lieu of directly attaching end terminals to protect the copper wire from corrosion, debris, and shorts.
![wire lug](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_lug.png)

Attach lugs to either end of the cut wire segments such that they are aligned on the same side. I.E. The lugs are parallel on the same plane. Very little, ideally none, of the copper in the wire itself should be exposed after attachment.
![wire lugs attached](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_lugs_attached.png)

Once the lugs are attached to each wire segment, they are laid out on the substrate with the same side facing up. It is important that only one side be facing outward to prevent the magnets from touching any part of the assembly while spinning. Note: There is adequate spacing between the bottom lugs to prevent shorting.
![wire lugs layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_lug_layout.png)
![flat wire lug layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_lug_layout_flat.png)

One of the selected substrate sheets, either HDPE (recommended) or marine-grade plywood, is to be cut to the size of the wire segments up to the lug tolerances. The cut tolerances should be measured after wire lug attachment and calculations should not be relied upon alone. The number of cuts is equal to the number of wire segments.
![wire substrate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate.png)

It is important to make the cuts such that the lug holes are given adequate space to ensure good attachment, but leaving enough material removed to clear the lug body itself.
![wire substrate cutouts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_cutouts.png)

The lug holes should all be on one side of the substrate and the other side should be clear.
![wire substrate installed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_installed.png)
Other side:
![wire substrate reverse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_reverse.png)

The thickness of the selected substrate, as mentioned in the supplies list, should be at least as thick as the wire, such that once the cutouts are made, only a small portion of the wire sheath should protrude above and below the sheet on both sides.
![wire substrate protrusion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_protrusion.png)
![wires installed closeup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_installed_closeup.png)

Once the position of the wire segments is satisfactory, mark and drill the lug hole locations on the substrate, the center hole for the shaft with adequate clearing for the locking collars, and the corner holes for the selected size allthread. Note: Because the stator will not be spinning, the exact position of the center hole is not absolutely critical, however, it is important that it be large enough to not touch any portion of the spinning shaft and locking collars during operation.
![wire substrate drilled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_drilled.png)

Check if the wire segment lug holes are correctly aligned with the drilled holes after this step is complete.
![wires on drilled substrate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_drilled_placed.png)
![reverse of drilled substrate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_drilled_reverse.png)

This concludes processing the stator substrate. The next step is connecting the wire segments into functional coils.

The stators coils are wired in this example as three(3) sets, matching the number of phases in the assembly, of four(4) in this example of 12 wire segments. For a stator with a larger number of segments, there will be more segments in a set, but should still have three total sets to match the number of poles in the assembly. To simplify wiring, select one set and completely wire it before moving on to the adjacent set.
![wire stator set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_stator_set.png)

Notice, one pair in the set is exposed to the North poles of the magnets, while the other pair is exposed to the South poles. This means the current will flow in opposite directions in each pair in the sets as the magnet gets close to the wire segments.
![magnet stator overlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/magnet_stator_overlay.png)

To bridge the inner segments, short lengths of household wiring, as in the supplies list of *12 AWG* to *14 AWG*, can be bent to connect the bottom segments. Notice, only a small section of the wire should be stripped to expose the copper conductor before the ends are bent into a loop. 
![short wire bridge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_bridge_short.png)

***IMPORTANT: Avoid straight runs of connecting wire within the influence of the magnetic field in order to reduce losses and accidentally induced current on the connecting pairs. Also avoid getting too near the center hole of the wire substrate or going past the outer edge.***

The connected segments are following the direction of current, and so the inner end of the North pole facing wire segment is connected to the inner end of the South pole facing segment.
![stator short bridge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/stator_short_bridge.png)

The outer end of the South pole facing segment is connected, via a longer version of the wire bridge, to the outer end of the other North pole facing wire segment. This completes a single set of the three phases.
![stator bridge set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/stator_bridge_set.png)

Notice, the wire bridge pattern is repeated to the other sets. Once a satisfactory curve and length is obtained, it is recommended the pattern be copied to the other pairs. 
![wire bridge pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_bridge_pattern.png)

The wire colors in this example are not critical and they are shown as being different to avoid confusion. The actual build process may use a single color wire, however using colors meant for specific use, such as green for ground or Earth, is not recommended. This convention may be discarded depending on the resources available to the builder.

It is recommended the ends be bent down such that their hooks are as close to the substrate as possible. There is an upper limit to the bend radius for the selected wire gauge. This reduced clearance will be important if the assembly is stacked with another magnet rotor behind this one.
![wire coil hooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_coil_hooks.png)

The wires should be stacked one on top of each other as they make their way around the stator for the same reason. The wire sheaths may be glued together to reduce the likelihood of movement during operation.
![wire stack clearence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_stack_clearance.png)

Once the wire bend and cut pattern is satisfactory, they may be attached via cross bolts and washers of conductive material. Note: It is important to select washers and nuts which will not cause galvanic corrosion when in contact with the copper lugs and wires. In this example, plated electrical screws and nuts are used along with copper washers.
![wire nuts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_nuts.png)

The selected screws are of the Phillips head type, however the actual fastener type is not as important as the material it is made of and the clearance to the surface. 
![wire bolts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_bolts.png)

Just as with the wires, the bolt head should not protrude too far to avoid contact with the magnet rotor during operation.
![wire bolt clearance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_bolt_clearence.png)

This concludes the build process of the stator.

### Rotor wheel
***IMPORTANT: Neodymium magnets are dangerous when brought together in close proximity. They may pull toward each other suddenly and catch fingers or clothing in between. Crashing magnets may splinter, sending sparks and fragments, which may damage eyesight. Builder caution is advised.***

The rotor wheel substrate can be made of the same material as the coil substrate, however HDPE is recommended due to its dimensional stability in most environmental conditions. Unlike the coil substrate, cutting the rotor wheel requires measurement precision and all cut segments should be identical to avoid excess vibrations during operation. HDPE and similar plastics are not well suited for most kinds of adhesives. While it is possible to weld thermoplastics, the process of attaching the magnets to the rotor wheel in this example involves folded metal clips.

The magnet slots are cut in equal size and the quantity of holes must match the wire segments. The center bore is the same diameter as the selected shaft.
![rotor magnet cutouts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/rotor_magnet_cutouts.png)

This example includes a keyway cut into the wheel at the top position in order to provide better grip on the shaft. Plastics such as HDPE offer little friction and so a keyway is strongly recommended.
![rotor keyway cutout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/rotor_keyway_cutout.png)

***IMPORTANT: One magnet at a time should be completely installed and the retaining clips folded *before* moving on to the next magnet.***

To allow for the insertion of the retaining clips, additional space is left above and below the magnet. The following is for illustrative purposes *only*.
![rotor magnet cutout spacing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/rotor_magnet_cutout_spacing.png)

The magnets are retained with a foldable metal clip, which may be cut from bus bar, or copper sheet, or other soft metal strip. *Note:* The center of the clip must remain attached while only the protruding sections are cut down the middle on either side of the wheel.
![rotor magnet retaining clip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/rotor_magnet_retaining_clip.png)

Once the magnet is placed in the cutout, only the slit ends should protrude.
![rotor magnet installed](https://github.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/blob/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/rotor_magnet_installed.png)

***The following is for illustration purposes only.*** Once again, completely install and fold the clips before moving on to the next magnet. Note, the magnets are installed in alternating North-South pattern.
![rotor magnets with clip retainers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/rotor_magnets_with_retainers.png)

***IMPORTANT: Do not hammer the clips. Only use bending force as hammering may cause the magnet to chip***.

The retaining clips are folded in one-up, one-down fashion on both sides such that the magnet is prevented from moving or twisting within the cutout during operation. This concludes the rotor wheel construction.
