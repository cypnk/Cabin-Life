# Three-phase assembly

A coil stator and magnet arrangement which can be used as an electric generator or motor. All parts may be scavenged or improvised as needed. The performance of the assembly depends on the type of components used and the speed of rotation. Exact components are left up to the builder, depending preference and local availability.

## Concept

The stator coils are made from identically cut segments of *0 AWG* to *4 AWG* stranded copper wire, in lieu of pre-wound coils. Dedicated magnet wire coils may be used, but these may be in short supply, too expensive, or unavailable. CCA or Copper-Clad Aluminum wire is not recommended. The magnets may be neodymium for increased performance, however, ferrite magnets of equivalent size may be used if there is not an adequate supply. The magnets must be of identical size and weight to avoid balance and vibration issues during operation.

The end terminals of the assembly are left separated so they may be wired in **Delta configuration** or **Y (WYE) configuration**. There are [benefits and drawbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power#Balanced_circuits) to each configuration and it may be necessary to change the assembly after construction or, in motor-mode, change during operation using a [soft starter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_soft_starter).

Supplies:
* Neodymium bar type (recommended) or round magnets with axial North South polarity (flat face N or S), slightly wider than selected wire
* * Ferrite (iron-ceramic) magnets may be used, but with lower performance
* 0 To 4 AWG or similarly thick *stranded* copper wire (E.G. battery cable, welding cable etc...)
* 12 To 14 AWG household-grade copper wiring
* 5/8" (~16+mm) to 1" (~25+mm) smooth, round, shaft rod or wheelbarrow axle
* Pillow block bearings, of flanged type or end type, matching the selected shaft diameter
* Locking collars matching the shaft diameter
* Crimped or soldered cable lugs, with throughholes
* 1/4" (~6.5mm) to 5/8" (~16mm) Allthread (this size is not critical)
* Nuts and washers matching the selected diameter allthread
* Screws and nuts matching cable lug holes
* HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) sheets at least as thick as the cable
* * Kitchen cutting boards may be used as HDPE material or marine grade plywood may be substituted if HDPE is not available
* Short lengths of bus bar or roll of copper
* * Copper flashing strips may be used if bus bar is not available

Tools:
* Crimping tool if crimped lugs are used
* Soldering iron and acid-free solder
* Hand drill or drill press
* Drill bits matching the selected cable lug holes
* Screwdriver or hex key (allen wrench) matching the tightening screw of the locking collars
* Hole saw with a diameter slightly larger than the selected locking collars
* Hand saw or router
* Wire stripping tool or box cutter
* Ruler or measuring tape
* Marker or pencil
* Hand saw or band saw
* Sandpaper
* Drawing compass or piece of string
* Wrench(es) matching all selected nuts
* Screwdriver(s) matching all selected screws
* Gloves (recommended when handling allthread, which can be sharp)

## Build process

***IMPORTANT: Avoid leaving dissimilar metals in contact with each other to reduce the risk of galvanic corrosion.*** Only use copper wire with copper connectors or metals specially coated to prevent galvanic corrosion while allowing good electrical contact. Some connections may need to be soldered to prevent corrosion.

The assembly is built in segment multiples of 3, to match the number of poles of the output/input. For a balance of power and ease of construction, assemblies between 12 and 24 segments are recommended. Increasing the number of segments will add to the output power in generator-mode or torque in motor-mode, however there is a practical upper limit. Builder discretion is advised.

The magnets should as wide or slightly wider than the selected wire gauge.

Note: Due to angular momentum of the rotor, which will have the magnets attached and will be spinning, it is recommended the magnet not exceed the thickness of the substrate (HDPE or marine-grade plywood) too much.

Cut the selected wire into segments slightly taller than the selected magnet, allowing for the wire lugs above and below.

Leaving the wire sheath intact is strongly recommended to protect the it from corrosion and the elements, as well as reduce the risk of electrical shorts, however it may be stripped for slightly increased performance by reducing magnet-to-wire tolerances. Magnet effectiveness will rapidly diminish with distance and leaving too much exposed wire, beyond what is needed for the wire lugs, will not meaningfully increase output power or torque.

The wire and magnet pairs are eventually arranged in a radial pattern on the selected substrate of HDPE board or marine-grade plywood.

Wire layout for a 24 segment 3-pole assembly. Note, the diameter of the assembly must increase to accommodate the greater number of components:

The number of magnets used must match the number of wire segments:
![magnet layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/magnet_layout.png)

The wire lugs used in this example are of the solder type, however crimp style lugs may be used. Use of lugs is strongly recommended in lieu of directly attaching end terminals to protect the copper wire from corrosion, debris, and shorts.
![wire lug](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_lug.png)

Attach lugs to either end of the cut wire segments such that they are aligned on the same side. I.E. The lugs are parallel on the same plane. Very little, ideally none, of the copper in the wire itself should be exposed after attachment.
![wire lugs attached](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_lugs_attached.png)

Once the lugs are attached to each wire segment, they are laid out on the substrate with the same side facing up. It is important that only one side be facing outward to prevent the magnets from touching any part of the assembly while spinning. Note: There is adequate spacing between the bottom lugs to prevent shorting.

![flat wire lug layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_lug_layout_flat.png)

One of the selected substrate sheets, either HDPE (recommended) or marine-grade plywood, is to be cut to the size of the wire segments up to the lug tolerances. The cut tolerances should be measured after wire lug attachment and calculations should not be relied upon alone. The number of cuts is equal to the number of wire segments.
![wire substrate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate.png)

It is important to make the cuts such that the lug holes are given adequate space to ensure good attachment, but leaving enough material removed to clear the lug body itself.
![wire substrate cutouts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_cutouts.png)

The lug holes should all be on one side of the substrate and the other side should be clear.

Other side:
![wire substrate reverse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_reverse.png)

The thickness of the selected substrate, as mentioned in the supplies list, should be at least as thick as the wire, such that once the cutouts are made, only a small portion of the wire sheath should protrude above and below the sheet on both sides.

![wires installed closeup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_installed_closeup.png)

Once the position of the wire segments is satisfactory, mark and drill the lug hole locations on the substrate, the center hole for the shaft with adequate clearing for the locking collars, and the corner holes for the selected size allthread. Note: Because the stator will not be spinning, the exact position of the center hole is not absolutely critical, however, it is important that it be large enough to not touch any portion of the spinning shaft and locking collars during operation.
![wire substrate drilled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_drilled.png)

Check if the wire segment lug holes are correctly alignged with the drilled holes after this step is complete.

![reverse of drilled substrate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Three-phase%20Assembly/wire_substrate_drilled_reverse.png)

This concludes processing the stator substrate. The next step is connecting the wire segments into functional coils.

Work in progress...
