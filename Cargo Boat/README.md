# Cargo Boat

This craft may be built on-site by anyone with reasonable carpentry skills using ordinary building supplies. It is meant to carry an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) or similar, other building supplies or tools and machinery including portable power generators, or a supply of fuel such as diesel in sealed containers or liquid petroleum gas tanks. 

## Concept

The sectioned construction, similar to conventional wall and floor framing, creates sealed compartments which will reduce the likelihood of capsizing when loaded, even if one or more compartments are compromised. The bottom surface is to be glued with construction adhesive and screwed into the bulkheads. The bottom hull can be treated with fiberglass or similar and sprayed with closed cell foam for additional redundancy if prolonged use is necessary. The entire top deck is meant to be replaceable and is only held in place with silicone. 

While the final dimensions are left to the builder's preferences, the sketch design is approximately 8 feet (~2.45m) wide and 16 feet (~4.88m) long. The cut lumber used are in U.S. units of measure 2"x4", 2"x8", and 2"x12" with larger plywood sheets in 4'x8'. Similar sizes may be used elsewhere. Maximum cargo capacity and displacement will depend on the type of building materials used, any related treatments, and the final craft size. The bottom will use two layers 3/4" pressure-treated plywood, overlapping the seams approximately half a sheet's width, glued and screwed to the bottom rails. Using two relatively thinner layers instead of a single thicker layer is a compromise to save weight and costs, while adding water-tightness and durability when beaching the boat.

All bottom joints are to be sealed with silicone if no fiberglass is used. The cargo ramp in front is attached via heavy-duty gate hinges, which may be replaced or repaired as needed. The craft is designed to remain afloat even if the loading ramp is lowered accidentally or if it is damaged while in motion.

## Rationale 

When moving machinery or supplies to remote locations, it may not be feasible or preferred to use conventional roadways. Most small utility craft are meant to be towed to the work site and then launched by reversing the tow trailer into the water. Most watercraft in general are not designed for handling cargo in the same footprint. 

While the use of traditional building lumber creates a heavier craft, the design is adequate for expedited construction when infrastructure is unavailable or a craft with similar capabilities cannot be procured. Most of the building materials may be locally sourced or can be scavenged from existing structures in the vicinity. It may be motorized as needed or may be paddle powered by a single operator.

Design in progress...

The main hull structure is composed of segments using 2x8 vertical rails joined to a 2x12 bottom rail. The vertical rails are up to the desired height of the boat, in this case slightly less than 4 feet. While this creates vertical sides, which are less visually appealing, it requires no special skills and cuts can be made with hand tools if necessary.

The segments are arranged up to the desired length of the main hull and the joins are reinforced with treated plywood gussets. This helps to reduce lateral movement once assembled. The front segment is reversed (gussets facing back) to accommodate the bow and loading ramp.

The spacing in this example is 16" center, similar to conventional framing.

The side reinforcement reduces flexing while doubling as bulkheads for each watertight compartment. Even if there is infiltration from the top, these reduce the leakage to the bottom.

The bottom spacing rails use 2x4 lumber. These side rails add stability to the corners and should be kept below the join gussets and above the bottom reinforcement.

The bottom side reinforcement is cut to the same length as the spacing rails and completes the corner profile of the boat.

The bow (front) of the boat is not meant to sustain repeated impacts, though it should be built with enough rigidity to withstand the weight of the ramp when deployed. This section is a series of horizontal compartments which also reduce the spread of leaks should one compartment be compromised.

The spacing here is also 16" on center, except for the end pieces, however it should be reduced to 12" or narrower should the boat be intended to carry greater weight. A single 2x12 board is strongly recommended for the top as it will sustain the most wear. If multiple narrower pieces of lumber are to be used, they must be glued together before installation.

The bow loading ramp is delimited on both sides with 2x8 rails, angled 45 degrees forward, and placed perpendicular to the bow. The length of this section and the exact angle is up to the builder's preference. The exact cut here isn't critical as long as it is 90 degrees at the approximate center, if the 45 degree ramp angle is used.

Note, these rails rest on the bow compartment's top plate and the furthest double layer of 2x12 lumber.

In this example, the side rails of the ramp are left as-is instead of cutting it flush with the final height of the boat. This leaves a portrusion above the final height of the boat which may be also used as a tie-off point.
