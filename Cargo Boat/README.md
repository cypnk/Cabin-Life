# Cargo Boat

This craft may be built on-site by anyone with reasonable carpentry skills using ordinary building supplies. It is meant to carry an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) or similar, other building supplies or tools and machinery including portable power generators, or a supply of fuel such as diesel in sealed containers or liquid petroleum gas tanks. 

## Concept

The sectioned construction, similar to conventional wall and floor framing, creates sealed compartments which will reduce the likelihood of capsizing when loaded, even if one or more compartments are compromised. The bottom surface is to be glued with construction adhesive and screwed into the bulkheads. The bottom hull can be treated with fiberglass or similar and sprayed with closed cell foam for additional redundancy if prolonged use is necessary. The entire top deck is meant to be replaceable and is only held in place with silicone.

While the final dimensions are left to the builder's preferences, the sketch design is approximately 8 feet (~2.45m) wide and 16 feet (~4.88m) long. The cut lumber used are in U.S. units of measure 2"x4", 2"x8", and 2"x12" with larger plywood sheets in 4'x8'. Similar sizes may be used elsewhere. Maximum cargo capacity and displacement will depend on the type of building materials used, any related treatments, and the final craft size.

All bottom joints are to be sealed with silicone if no fiberglass is used. The cargo ramp in front is attached via heavy-duty gate hinges, which may be replaced or repaired as needed. The craft is designed to remain afloat even if the loading ramp is lowered accidentally or damaged while in motion.

## Rationale 

When moving machinery or supplies to remote locations, it may not be feasible or preferred to use conventional roadways. Most small utility craft are meant to be towed to the work site and then launched by reversing the tow trailer into the water. Most watercraft in general are not designed for handling cargo in the same footprint. 

While the use of traditional building lumber creates a heavier craft, the design is adequate for expedited construction when infrastructure is unavailable or a craft with similar capabilities cannot be procured. Most of the building materials may be locally sourced or can be scavenged from existing structures in the vicinity. It may be motorized as needed or may be paddle powered by a single operator.
