# Laser Path

This is a sketch concept to create a laser-based direction indicator for wayward explorers, pedestrians, or hikers which is suitable for use in extremely bad weather I.E. heavy snow storms, severe fog, dust, smoke caused by forest fires etc... It would function as a land variant of a lighthouse, while achieving maximum range with minimum attenuation (blooming), unlike a conventional light source. The laser path is only intended for these low-visibility conditions as clear weather would make the beam invisible. The laser requires water vapor, snow, or other small particles to strike the beam to make it visible.

## Concept

A pair of lasers of the same visible wavelength, pointing in the same direction, and arranged in such a way above the line of sight that the direction of travel is immediately obvious: **The viewer (hiker or pedestrian) is supposed to travel toward the laser pair.** 

The color is not particularly important as long as it is bright enough for the environment in which it is used and low enough in intensity to not cause fires. The minimum height of the laser path should be at least 240cm or about 8 feet, and no more than 500cm or roughly 16.5 feet to ensure low-lying obstacles don't intrude on the beams, to prevent the laser from accidentally striking the viewer, and to prevent striking any low-flying aircraft. 

If during emergencies a greater height is needed, or if the laser is installed on predetermined paths ahead of time, an end stop or target is required at the same height to prevent the laser from continuing beyond safe distances.

The lasers are to be arranged from top left to bottom right in descending fashion:

       \       \

         \       \
          \       \
           \       \
            \       \
             \       \
              \       \
               \       \
               Laser Diode O
```
A set of lasers may be installed at each "Laser diode" point for added redundancy in case one or more of the laser diodes fail due to moisture intrusion, power surge, or other failure mode.

The center piece can be a dedicated bracket fashioned from metal, 3D printed, or improvised on the spot. The angle of the bracket should be approximately -45 degrees. The distance between lasers can be left up to the installer, but should be no closer together than the shoulder-to-shoulder width or head-to-stomach height of the person doing the installation.

## Rationale 

Lasers were selected because diodes are now ample, cheap, and durable. They will remain coherent over distances relevant for rescue navigation on land. Power requirements for lasers are also much lower than a conventional point source intended to reach the same distances. Lasers may also be setup in a field during emergencies to run off a battery supply for days or weeks.

When facing the laser path source, the viewer sees the top and bottom lasers in the same orientation as the top and bottom anchor points of a seat belt (shoulder to hip) in the driver's side of a vehicle meant for use in right-hand traffic. This arrangement was selected to reduce ambiguity in case the viewer is disoriented, suffering from hypothermia, or is otherwise cognitively impaired. The use of only two lasers minimizes resources and can be improvised by using just two laser pointers during an emergency.

Many rural residents often have to venture out for provisions and may become lost at some point during bad weather, even with intimate familiarity of the location in clear weather. Laser paths installed during clear weather periods may be set to automatically activate during bad weather events, or via radio control, and may be powered by long-term storable power sources such as LiFePOâ‚„ or AGM batteries charged by attached solar panels during the day in clear weather.
