# Solar Air Heater

This is an improvised air heater meant to supplement the heating needs of a small space such as a cabin or room. 

## Concept
The heater frame is constructed from ordinary plywood and the main heating elements are two corrugated steel panels which are painted black to absorb greater solar thermal radiation and protect them from corrosion. The front face of the heater is ordinary glass, however acrylic sheets or other durable plastic material may be used. The front surface is only to reduce heat leakage to the wind and is only held in place with silicone.

One corrugated sheet extends the entire interior height of the frame while the second is cut short to rest on a "shelf" which will provide the second chamber air cavity. The full height corrugated sheet need not be fastened to the frame and can be held in place with steel wire. The shorter sheet is held in place with steel wire and silicone.

Work in progress...
