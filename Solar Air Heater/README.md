# Solar Air Heater

This is an improvised air heater meant to supplement the heating needs of a small space such as a cabin or Sun-facing room.

## Rationale

Heating smaller spaces is difficult without adequate balance during certain times of the year, especially if wood for burning is unavailable or out of season, or if firing up a stove would lead to unreasonably hot temperatures. When the Sun is out and at a low angle, it may be preferable to use a heating panel made from commonly available materials instead or supplement existing heat sources inside. 

Corrugated steel is relatively easy to obtain or scavange if necessary. In addition, corrugated panels increase the surface area for air contact. Plywood and similar lumber is also relatively easily procure in small quantities or scavanaged or recycled from other projects in the areas in which this heater is intened to be used.

## Concept

The heater frame is constructed from outdoor rated plywood and the main heating elements are two corrugated steel panels which are painted black to absorb greater solar thermal radiation and protect them from corrosion. The paint should be thermally stable and should be off-gassed before installing the heater. A fan system may be added to the lower cavity to push air into the panel. With enough of a thermal gradient, a series of peltier modules in contact with one of the corrugated sheets may be used to power a small fan, which would eliminate the need for a dedicated power supply.

This version of the heater does not use any special insulation for simplicity, however styrofoam sheets may be added to the exterior of the frame to concentrate the heating effect. It is important that the styrofoam, if used, not come into direct contact with any of the heated metal.

One corrugated sheet extends the entire interior height of the frame interior, with a small gap for thermal expansion, while the second inner panel is cut short to rest on a shelf, which will create the entry into the air chamber. The full height corrugated sheet need not be fastened to the frame and can be held in place with steel wire. The shorter panel is held in place with steel wire and silicone on the bottom and sides. Alternatively, the panel edges may be sandwiched between thinner vertical strips of wood. Using wood strips across the middle of the sheets is not recommended due to the possibilty of warping in high heat. The steel wire will also sag, along with the corrugated sheet, but it should not completely block the air cavity.

The frame of the heater may be made from 3/4 inch treated plywood or other suitable lumber of similar thickness. The exact dimensions are not absolutely critical, however the inner support for the first corrugated panel should be slightly less than 1/2 the depth of the entire assembly. The frame in this example is approximately 23" wide and 60" tall which would allow it to capture heat from sunrise to sunset if facing south in the northern hemisphere.

The rear of the assembly has two cuts. The lower cut allows air into the heater and it exits back to the heated space from the top cut.

The inner shelf supports the inner corrugated panel. The air from the interior travels over the inner panel. The inner corrugated panel may be supported with steel wire and sealed in place with silicone or the above edge strip method.

The shelf on the inside is set slightly off the floor of the assembly to allow air to enter the space between the front corrugated panel and the inner panel.

The inner corrugated panel stops short of the top of the assembly to allow air to enter behind it in order to come out the back.

The outer panel is installed for closed loop air heating. For open loop air exchanging, it may be removed along with the top cover. The outer panel extends the full height of the frame except for a small gap on the top for thermal expansion and is as close as possible to the front cover without actually touching it.

The front face of the heater can be ordinary glass, however acrylic sheets or other durable plastic material may be used if glass is not available or prohibitively expensive. The purpose of the front surface is to reduce heat leakage to the wind and is only held in place with silicone.

The exterior of the frame should be edged with a strip of similar building material, half the thickness of the frame, to better secure the front cover and to reduce the sail effect in high wind areas. This "lip" also reduces the likelihood of water intrusion during rains, increasing the lifetime of the corrugated panels.
