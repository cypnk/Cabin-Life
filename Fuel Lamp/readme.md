# Fuel Lamp
This is a basic liquid fuel burning lamp for lighting and, possibly, minimal heating purposes made from basic supplies and simple tools. Most of the components may be scavenged from household supplies.

**Warning: Do not leave any open flame unattended. Ensure adequate ventilation when operating any fuel-burning device.**

Components:
* Small diameter copper refrigerant tubing, or vehicle brake tube with an uncoated lining, or similar
* Metal flat sheet to act as the wick roller and holder, must be thin enough to be cut with shears or tin snips
* Thin spindle metal rod, rigid enough to turn the wick roller E.G. coat hanger wire
* High temperature epoxy E.G. J-B Weld or similar
* Thick-walled glass or metal container with a spill-proof metal lid such as a mason jar or wide-bottom vial
* Small-diameter wick or cotton rags (do not use synthetic fabrics)

Tools:
* Scissors
* Metal file
* Tin snips or metal shears
* Small-diameter, thin grinder wheel and grinder
