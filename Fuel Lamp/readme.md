# Fuel Lamp
This is a basic liquid fuel burning lamp for lighting and, possibly, minimal heating purposes made from basic supplies and simple tools. Most of the components may be scavenged from household supplies.

**Warning: Do not leave any open flame unattended. Ensure adequate ventilation when operating any fuel-burning device.**

Components:
* Small diameter copper refrigerant tubing, or vehicle brake tube with an uncoated lining, or similar
* Metal flat sheet to act as the wick roller and holder, must be thin enough to be cut with shears or tin snips
* Thin spindle metal rod, rigid enough to turn the wick roller E.G. coat hanger wire
* High temperature epoxy E.G. J-B Weld or similar
* Thick-walled glass or metal container with a spill-proof metal lid such as a mason jar or wide-bottom vial
* Small-diameter wick or cotton rags (do not use synthetic fabrics)

Tools:
* Scissors
* Metal file
* Tin snips or metal shears
* Small-diameter, thin grinder wheel and grinder
* Drill and drill bit matching the selected tubing

## Build process

Cut a length of the selected tubing material appoximately 5cm - 6cm long. This will be the wick tube.

Using the grinder wheel and grinder, cut a slot starting from the bottom of the tube to approximately half way up the tube.

Using the flat stock material, create a wrap-around flange with a middle wide enough to fit the wick tube, while still remaining loose.

Put the wick tube through the flange to ensure proper fit. The gap and the cut in the tube need not be identical, but close enough to ensure the following control wheel can fit through both.

Using the same flat stock, cut a circle approximately 1.5x the diameter of the wick tube and punch a hole in the middle. The circle need not be absolutely perfect, but the closer it is to a perfect circle, the better. The diameter of the hole is the same as the spindle metal rod. The wheel may be roughened or have teeth cut into it for better grip.

Punch a hole through the wrap flanges as close to parallel as possible. The gap between the flanges should be the thickness of the wheel material or just slightly wider. The position of the hole is approximately half way the height of the flange and slighly closer to the tube side.

Create the wick control assembly by putting the control rod through one side of the wrap around flange, through the control wheel, and the other flange.

Slide the wick tube over the control assembly to complete the control tube.
