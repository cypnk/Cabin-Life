# Cooler / Refrigerator
This is a basic cold storage system for smaller dwellings, using off-the-shelf components, suitable for use with solar power

## Rationale
When the available power source in a small dwelling is less than typical AC voltages, it may be necessary to use 12V or similar sources and maximize the duration of effective cooling, even when the power source is removed for short periods. For these situations, vertical, floor-standing fridges expose too much of the interior to the outside on each door opening. Chest-type freezers, with their upward opening doors, retain more of the coldness inside and can be run more efficiently at lower power.

While existing chest freezers may be modified to run as fridges on lower power, a custom built cooler or fridge can be more flexible for individual needs and power demands, as well as be considerably less expensive for a given volume. Knowing every component that goes into such a device will also enable easier repair or replacement of components than commercial variants.

## Concept
A series of peltier modules are attached to metal cooling blocks, one on the hot side and another, oriented downwards, on the cool side. Silicone tubing is used to reduce the likelihood of leaks as the coolant used is isopropyl alcohol; a strong solvent. The hot side is the return side and is connected to the upper port of an off-the-shelf coolant tank. The vapor pressure created inside the tank by partially evaporated isopropyl alcohol, drives the liquid through the lower segments of the tubing.

The exact outer dimensions of the cooler and interior capacity is left to the builder's preference, however the cooling-critical component measurements are given.

**IMPORTANT: *Alcohol is flammable and fumes are dangerous in high concentrations. Exercise caution when making connections and filling the coolant tank. Ensure good ventilation during the filling process and avoid any open flames or sparks nearby.

## Components
- 2x Cooling blocks 40 x 120mm (Cu or Al, depending on availability) with dual ports
- 3x Peltier 40 x 40mm modules at 12V each
- 2x Computer/CPU liquid cooling radiators at least 120mm wide
- Cooling fan matching the interior radiator, optional fan(s) for the exterior radiator
- Anhydrous isopropyl alcohol
- Automotive, aftermarket coolant reservoir tank (solvent resistant), with ports matching the sizes of the cooling blocks
- Food-grade silicone tubing with an internal diameter matching the ports on the cooling blocks and the tank
- Polypropylene right angle (90 degree) connectors matching the tubing internal diameter
- Foil-faced, extruded polystyrene, rigid foam boards
- Reflective HVAC ducting tape
- Silicone sealant
- Plywood sheets (avoid exterior grade or "marine" plywood if the cooler is installed indoors)
- Locking wheel casters suitable for the estimated capacity of the cooler

**WARNING: *Avoid reusing an existing coolant tank previously installed in a vehicle as coolant chemicals are highly toxic and may contaminate the cooler in case of a leak.***

**IMPORTANT: *Avoid PVC tubing and connectors, also labeled "vinyl", used in aquariums and typical CPU cooling applications. Connectors should be made of rigid polypropylene or similar material. Alcohol is a strong solvent and some less-tolerant materials may leak or be completely destroyed over time.***

Cooling fans may be used on the exterior radiators for greater performance or left out for silent operation. The radiators may be identical in size or else, the selected exterior radiator must be larger than the interior one.
