# Structure Roofing

This is the basic roof layout intended to be used on the [framing layout](https://github.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/tree/master/Structure%20Framing) for the multi-purpose structure. The number of rafters may be extended as needed for the longer version of the frame.

Design in progress...
