# Wood Stove

This is a cabin wood stove that is suitable for a small footprint

The exterior dimensions of the stove are 24" wide, 20" tall ( 14" tall, excluding the legs ) and 14" deep. The flue is sized for 4" diameter stove pipe. The stove main structure is intended for 1/4" thick steel plate and angle stock. The fire gate is made of thicker plates of steel, which can alternatively be substituted with steel rods. The interior of the fire box is designed to handle 16" logs, which is a typical length in the U.S. The dampers can be made of thinner steel, however the control rods are also 1/4" in diameter to ensure adequate strength at high temperatures. Alternatively, the control rods can be made of steel bar instead, provided the thickness will not obstruct airflow.

The top plate is 1/2" thick and is intended to be used as cooktop as well as function as a thermal mass to evenly distribute and retain heat. The door interior requires fiberglass rope or similar high temperature seal to serve as a gasket if installed indoors.

This stove design is a close approximation of the final construction and is not intended to serve as an exact blueprint. It is meant to display one possible arrangement for a stove layout of this size and control placement.

Please consult your local building codes prior to construction and installation within a dwelling.

The top surface is as flat as possible to maximize cooking area without interfering with the rear flue pipe, when installed

This assembly controls both primary and secondary air flow on either side of the stove with a single lever each. The half-circle offset makes it more inclined to close than remain open, which adds to the stove's safety. The friction between the plates is what allows it to remain open.
