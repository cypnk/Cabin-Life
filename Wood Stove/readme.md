# Wood Stove

This is a cabin wood stove that is suitable for a small footprint

The exterior dimensions of the stove are 24" wide, 20" tall ( 14" tall, excluding the legs ) and 14" deep. The flue is sized for 4" diameter stove pipe. The stove main structure is intened for 1/4" thick steel plate and angle stock. The fire gate is made of thicker plates of steel, which can alternatively be substituted with steel rods. The interior of the fire box is designed to handle 16" logs, which is a typical length in the U.S. The dampers can be made of thinner steel, however the control rods are also 1/4" in diameter to ensure adequate strength at high temperatures.

The top plate is 1/2" thick and is intended to be used as cooktop. The door interior requires fibereglass rope or similar high temperature seal to serve as a gasket if installed indoors.

This stove design is a close approximation of the final construction and is not intended to serve as an exact blueprint. It is meant to display one possible arrangement for a stove layout of this size and control placement.

Please consult your local building codes prior to construction and installation within a dwelling.
