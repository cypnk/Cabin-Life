# Directional WiFi Antenna
For remote, point-to-point links, this antenna may be built from household wiring, roof flashing, and other scavanged sources of material.

![antenna profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cypnk/Cabin-Life/master/Directional%20Wifi%20Antenna/antenna_profile.png)

## Materials
* Copper (recommened) or Zinc roof and gutter flashing material
* 14 AWG household wiring
* RG-316 or similar WiFi-suitable coaxial cable pigtail
* Insulating separator dowel material of 3mm to 10mm wide. Plastic, wood etc...

### Material alternatives 
* Brass or aluminum (aluminium) sheet can be substituted for the radiator elements and backplane
* Hot glue may be used as the insulating separator, however the segments must be held in position until the glue solidifies completely
* Coax cable may be improvised from 14 AWG insulated household wire, tubular desoldering braid as shielding, and heat shrink tubing for the outer sheath

## Tools
* Drill and drill bit
* Soldering iron and acid free solder
* Tin snips (aviation snips) or similar metal cutting tool
* Wire stripper or blade to trim insulation and cut dowels
* Optional masking tape

## Build process

The selected sheet material is cut into four(4), equal sized, 20mm x 20mm squares for the radiator elements.

The backplane is cut as a single 60mm x 80mm rectangle.

The radiator elements are separated 30mm on center. The squares may be temporarily taped to ensure they don't move during the soldeirng process.

The 14 AWG wire is bent to give 6mm "legs" to the center of the radiator squares, the width of the segment is 30mm, matching the center separation. The length of wire on the square itself is not critical, except it must be long enough to give enough structural support while soldering.

This creates a single driven element segment. 

Two of the segments are separated vertically 30mm apart at the center, just as their individual squares. The measurement for the separation can be made at middle joining wire. Another length of 30mm wire is cut and soldered at the middle. This completes the driven elements.

Flipped over to the smooth side, the driven elements are centered vertically and horizontally on the backplane.

The driven elements are spaced 6mm off the backplane surface.

The backplane is drilled at the separation feed point center location. The drilled hole should allow the center core of the coaxial cable through, but not be too wide.

The selected coax cable should be stripped of the outer sheath to expose the braided shield, and the center conductor.

Both the center conductor and the braided shield should be trimmed to maintain the 6mm spacing of the driven elements off the baclpane.

Before soldering the braided coax, insert insulation dowels, cut at 6mm height, underneath the driven element squares (not under the wire, but the square itself). The braid is trimmed and soldered to the backplane and the center conductor to the driven element separation segment.

Once the braid and center conductor are soldered, the antenna is complete.
